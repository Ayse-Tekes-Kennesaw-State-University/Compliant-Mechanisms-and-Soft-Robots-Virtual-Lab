# Compliant-Mechanisms-and-Soft-Robots-Virtual-Lab
#### Compliant Mechanisms and Soft Robots
Compliant mechanisms and soft robots have received great attention due to their superior inherent properties in bending under the action of external forces mimicking motions found in nature. Compliant mechanisms or flexible machines can be considered as the base of soft robotics, or alternatively, soft robotics can be seen as an application area of high mobility flexible mechanisms. Soft robotics is an emerging field that deals with the design, modeling, and fabrication of robotic systems made of soft and compliant materials mimicking the motion in nature. Soft robotics is an interdisciplinary field of research that includes different engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and materials engineering. 

#### Description
We present a user-friendly and open-access MATLAB Toolbox for the design and motion analysis of compliant mechanisms and soft robots.
